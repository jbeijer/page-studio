# PageStudio Refactoring Plan

This directory contains a comprehensive plan for refactoring the PageStudio codebase to improve maintainability, reduce code complexity, and follow best practices.

## Current Issues

The codebase currently has several large files that exceed 500 lines, making them difficult to maintain:

- `Canvas.svelte`: 2916 lines
- `+page.svelte`: 1030 lines
- `Toolbar.svelte`: 645 lines
- `storage.js`: 615 lines

Additionally, there is code duplication, overlapping responsibilities, and complex state management that could be improved.

## Refactoring Goals

- Break down large files into smaller, focused modules and components
- Target approximately 500 lines per file maximum
- Improve separation of concerns
- Reduce code duplication
- Enhance testability
- Maintain all existing functionality

## Plan Documents

1. **[Canvas Modules](canvas-modules.md)** - Plan for refactoring the Canvas component
   - Breaking down Canvas.svelte (2916 lines) into smaller, focused modules

2. **[Canvas Implementation](canvas-implementation.md)** - Detailed implementation guide for Canvas refactoring
   - Code examples and implementation strategy

3. **[Page Component Refactoring](page-component-refactoring.md)** - Plan for refactoring the Editor page
   - Breaking down +page.svelte (1030 lines) into smaller components

4. **[Toolbar Refactoring](toolbar-refactoring.md)** - Plan for refactoring the Toolbar component
   - Breaking down Toolbar.svelte (645 lines) into feature-specific components

5. **[Storage and Utilities](storage-and-utilities.md)** - Plan for refactoring storage and utility modules
   - Breaking down storage.js (615 lines) and improving utility functions

6. **[Implementation Sequence](implementation-sequence.md)** - Phased implementation timeline
   - Recommended order for implementing changes
   - Testing strategy and rollout plan

## Key Architecture Changes

1. **Module Structure**
   - Breaking down large files into modules with clear responsibilities
   - Creating interfaces between modules
   - Using a shared Canvas context pattern

2. **Component Hierarchy**
   - More focused, smaller UI components
   - Clear prop and event interfaces
   - Consistent patterns for state management

3. **Utility Organization**
   - Shared utilities for common operations
   - Consistent error handling and logging
   - Reduced code duplication

## Implementation Strategy

The refactoring will be implemented in phases:

1. **Utilities & Infrastructure** (Week 1)
   - Create base utility modules
   - Refactor storage functionality
   - Update dependencies

2. **Canvas Component Refactoring** (Weeks 2-3)
   - Create module structure
   - Implement core functionality
   - Implement advanced features
   - Update Canvas.svelte

3. **UI Component Refactoring** (Weeks 4-5)
   - Refactor Toolbar component
   - Refactor Editor page
   - Extract business logic

4. **Integration & Optimization** (Week 6)
   - Integration testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Code cleanup

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
- **Extensibility**: Clearer extension points for new features
- **Testability**: Isolated components with clear boundaries are easier to test
- **Performance**: Opportunities for optimization through better code organization
- **Developer Experience**: Less cognitive load when working with smaller modules

## Getting Started

To begin implementing this refactoring plan:

1. Review the detailed plans for each component
2. Follow the implementation sequence
3. Test thoroughly after each change
4. Update documentation as you go

## Notes for Future Maintenance

After this refactoring is complete:

- New components should follow the same patterns established here
- Keep files under 500 lines by extracting functionality when needed
- Use the shared utilities for common operations
- Maintain clear interfaces between components
