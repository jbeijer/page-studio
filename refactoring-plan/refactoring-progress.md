This document tracks the progress of the PageStudio refactoring effort.

## Canvas Module Refactoring Progress

### Modules Refactored to Services

| Original Module | Service Implementation | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| Canvas.events.js | CanvasEventService.js | âœ… Completed | Refactored to use singleton pattern |
| Canvas.grid.js | GridService.js | âœ… Completed | Enhanced with improved error handling |
| Canvas.guides.js | GuideService.js | âœ… Completed | Enhanced with improved guide management |
| Canvas.layers.js | LayerService.js | âœ… Completed | Better layer management and object ordering |
| Canvas.objects.js | ObjectService.js | âœ… Completed | Handles object manipulation, clipboard operations |
| Canvas.document.js | DocumentModuleService.js | âœ… Completed | Complements existing DocumentService |
| Canvas.context.js | ContextService.js | âœ… Completed | Enhanced with better context management features |
| Canvas.index.js | services/index.js | âœ… Completed | Centralized services exports |
| Canvas.masters.js | MasterPageService.js | âœ… Completed | Existing service covering masters functionality |
| Canvas.history.js | HistoryService.js | âœ… Completed | Enhanced with better history state management |
| Canvas.clipboard.js | Implemented in ObjectService | âœ… Completed | Clipboard functionality integrated into ObjectService |
| Canvas.tools.js | ToolService.js | âœ… Completed | Enhanced with better tool management features |
| Canvas.textflow.js | TextFlowService.js | âœ… Completed | Enhanced with better text flow management |

### Integration Progress

- âœ… Updated Canvas.svelte to use all refactored services
- âœ… Ensured proper initialization and cleanup of services
- âœ… Created proper service test files
- âœ… Implemented dependency injection pattern
- âœ… Updated CHANGELOG.md to reflect changes
- âœ… Service-based approach for shared context (replaced createCanvasContext)
- âœ… Integration of all services with the Toolbar component
- ðŸ”„ Update existing tests to work with the service-based architecture (in progress)

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Improve Canvas.svelte initialization to use the service-based approach more consistently
   - Created centralized initializeServices() function
   - Created centralized cleanupServices() function
   - Improved initialization order and dependency handling
   - Added robust error handling during initialization and cleanup
   - Updated context management to work with the service architecture

2. âœ… Finalize integration of all services with the Toolbar component
   - Updated DrawingTools.svelte to use ToolService for tool management
   - Updated Toolbar.svelte to use services instead of direct canvas functions
   - Improved initialization of services from the Toolbar component
   - Enhanced error handling and state management in toolbar components

3. âœ… Complete the testing coverage for all services
   - Added MasterPageService.test.js for comprehensive testing of master page functionality
   - Added ServiceProvider.test.js to test the component that provides services to the application
   - Added getServices.test.js to test the utility for accessing services from components
   - Added ServiceIntegration.test.js to test the adapter layer for legacy components
   - Ensured all services have comprehensive test coverage

4. Update architectural documentation to reflect the new service-based approach

## Known Issues

- Some circular dependencies may need to be resolved between services
- A few legacy references to the old module functions remain
- Additional cleanup needed in Canvas.svelte to fully realize the target size reduction
